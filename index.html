<p>I've been in love with web-development since 2007, mainly credit to Ruby on Rails. Recently, I'm most excited to work with Elixir and Elm. I love producing polished UIs, as well as clean and well-architectured code.</p>

<p>During a few years, I developed and maintained <a href="http://netzke.org">Netzke</a> - an ExtJS/Rails library, that helps building desktop-like web-application in a conveniently modular way. I gave a few talks on Netzke at Ruby conferences around the world, one example being <a href="http://stream.rubydaily.org/post/53936363442/rapid-development-of-enterprise-web-apps-with">RubyKaigi 2013</a> in Tokyo.</p>

<a id="freelancing" class="anchor" href="#freelancing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Freelancing</h3>

<p>I've worked with a number of companies from Europe, Asia and the US. As I'm very mobile, I prefer spending the initial month working on-site, so that I get closely acquainted with the project and the team, and then I switch to working remotely for another few months. I choose to work 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, so that I'm always focused, fresh and productive.</p>

<p>Here's an example of feedback I occasionally get from developers I work with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m very happy with having you on the team. I like how you are just part of the team, like the rest, despite being remote. I especially like how I don’t have to worry about whether you are stuck or anything; I know if something comes up, you’ll let us know.</p>
