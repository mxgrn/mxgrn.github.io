I love producing polished UIs, as well as clean and well-architectured code.\r\n\r\n### Open source work\r\nDuring a few years, I developed and maintained [Netzke](http://netzke.org) - an ExtJS/Rails library, that helps building desktop-like web-application in a conveniently modular way. I gave a few talks on Netzke at Ruby conferences around the world, one example being [RubyKaigi 2013](http://stream.rubydaily.org/post/53936363442/rapid-development-of-enterprise-web-apps-with) in Tokyo.\r\n\r\n### Freelancing\r\nI've worked with a number of companies from Europe, Asia and the US. As I'm very mobile, I prefer spending the initial month working on-site, so that I get closely acquainted with the project and the team, and then I switch to working remotely for another few months. I choose to work 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, so that I'm always focused, fresh and productive.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of feedback I occasionally get from developers I work with:\r\n\r\n> I’m very happy with having you on the team. I like how you are just part of the team, like the rest, despite being remote. I especially like how I don’t have to worry about whether you are stuck or anything; I know if something comes up, you’ll let us know.\r\n\r\n--- [Arjan van der Gaag](https://twitter.com/avdgaag), received on Slack on April 25, 2016.\r\n\r\n### My pet projects\r\n\r\n* [Pairs One](http://pairs.one) - multi-player Memory game that works without registration (Elm, Elixir/Phoenix, Redis)\r\n* [!Fragmenter](https://fragmenter.net) - an online diary with a few unique features (React, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL)\r\n\r\n### Get in touch!\r\nYou can reach me on email: gorinme at gmail. I speak English, Russian, Spanish, and Dutch.",
